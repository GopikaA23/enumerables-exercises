answers:


#1) Has teacher Shanta taught a student who has secured 80% marks and above on an average?

school_hash.filter{|x| x[:teacher] == "Shanta" && (x[:mark1].to_i + x[:mark2].to_i)/2 >= 80}.map{|x| x[:student]}

#2) List the names of students and teachers.

school_hash.map{|i| i[:student]}
school_hash.map{|i| i[:teacher]}

#3) How many subjects does Murali study?

res = school_hash.select{|i| i[:student]=="Murali"}
res.count{|k| k[:subject]}

#4) Is there a girl in the class?

school_hash.any?{|i| i[:gender]=="female"}

#5) Find all students who have secured above 85% in any subject?

school_hash.find_all{|i| i[:student] && (i[:mark1].to_i + i[:mark2].to_i)/2 >= 85}.map{|i| i[:student]}.uniq


#6) Have all students secured above 80% in Geography?

school_hash.all?{|x| x[:subject] == "Geography" && (x[:mark1].to_i + x[:mark2].to_i)/2 >= 80}
